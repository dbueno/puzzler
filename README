Puzzler is a generic puzzle assistant.  Puzzler is a GTK2 program written in
Haskell.  Its aim is to help the puzzle-enthusiast with the mechanical and dull
parts of puzzle solving.

* Current Features

** Anagram generation.  Given an alphabet, a string of letters, puzzler can
   generate all the anagrams that match a given pattern.  For example,

       alphabet: "pianohid"   pattern: "????????"
       --> ophidian

       alphabet: "andbit"     pattern: "???"
       --> aid ait and ani ant bad ban bat bid bin bit dab dan dib din dit iba
           nab nat nib nid nit tab tad tai tan tib tid tin

* Coming Soon

** Custom anagram dictionaries
Soon you should be able to load your own word lists into puzzler.
